# A-B-Testing-Analysis ||  Summary & Recommendation

## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to determine if a new webpage design led to a statistically significant change in the user conversion rate compared to the old design.

## Results
* **Control Group (Old Design) Conversion Rate:** 12.04%
* **Treatment Group (New Design) Conversion Rate:** 11.88%
* **P-value:** 0.2289

## Conclusion
The p-value (0.23) is significantly higher than our significance level of 0.05. This means we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. There is no statistically significant evidence to suggest that the new design performs any differently than the old design. The small drop in conversion rate observed is likely due to random chance.

## Recommendation
**Do not launch the new design.** Based on this A/B test, the new design does not provide a statistically significant improvement in conversion rate. Resources would be better spent on developing and testing other design variations.
